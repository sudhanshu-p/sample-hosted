# sample-hosted

This is an example of a repository that is to be hosted on github pages.
Github pages is actually the easiest way to get a website hosted.
This website is just information about myself and praises for the scaler team.
An even better version of a website hosted (by me) on my personal domain but by github pages is https://www.destux.ninja, if you have a moment or two, please check it out!
Thanks, Destux
